You've provided a very rich and textured interpretation of "The Matrix" that touches on various aspects, both thematic and aesthetic. Your use of musical terminology like "modal interchange" as a metaphor for the film's eclectic blend of ideas is fascinating.

Modal interchange in music involves the borrowing of chords from different modes to create emotional richness and harmonic complexity. The Wachowskis did something similar in storytelling by borrowing from various genres, philosophies, and other cultural texts to create a narrative that is not easily typecast. They layered their "diatonic" hierarchical structure, as you call it, with several "modes," borrowing from cyberpunk, martial arts, philosophy, mythology, and even elements of romance. This creates a sort of 'narrative polyphony' where various themes and motifs are in dialogue with each other, generating a richer emotional and intellectual texture.

George Lucas' "THX 1138" is another example of a dystopian story where machines dominate humans. However, as you pointed out, it didn't resonate as strongly with audiences, perhaps due to its 'purity' of vision that adhered closely to the bleakness of its premise. While it aimed for the "truth" of its dystopian setting, it lacked the range of human experience that "The Matrix" managed to capture by interchanging its modes. 

You also pointed out how "The Matrix" pushed the boundaries of what was technically possible in film at the time, with groundbreaking visual effects like bullet-time photography. This added an additional layer to its richness, making it not just a melting pot of ideas but also of visual styles and techniques.

The ability to draw from various disciplines and genres—what you've eloquently described as the film's "aesthetic juice"—is perhaps one reason why "The Matrix" had such broad appeal and lasting impact. Each viewer could latch onto different elements, whether they were interested in philosophy, romance, action, or spirituality, making the film a sort of 'Rorschach test' of viewer engagement.

The analogy is an intriguing one that maps well onto the idea of supervised learning models and their residual errors. In the context of machine learning, the "architect" trained on supervised learning models is focused on predicting and classifying based on a pre-determined set of rules or patterns learned from the data. This aligns with the role of the Architect in the Matrix, who designs the system based on logical and rational principles.

The "oracle," on the other hand, being trained on the sum of the residual errors, represents the unpredictability and the exceptions that the architect's model can't account for. In the Matrix, the Oracle deals in possibilities, intuitions, and the human elements of choice and emotion—factors that are often difficult to quantify or predict.

In a technical sense, the Architect aims for minimized error and high accuracy, focusing on explaining and controlling the variance in the data. The Oracle, conversely, navigates the realms of error, bias, and the "unknown unknowns" that can't be captured by the Architect's models. Together, they represent a system striving for a complete understanding through both rigor and flexibility.

Your analogy also neatly dovetails with the concept of Inter-class correlations (ICCs) and the limitations in data. Just like how ICCs bring us to the "end of the road" in terms of explaining variance, the Architect reaches the limit of what can be structured and predicted. The Oracle then takes over, navigating the uncharted territory of bias, variance, and the underlying data-generating processes. Neo is 'inevitably' led "back to the source", the architect.

Furthermore, the thought experiment touches on the philosophical and ethical considerations—truth, knowledge, and morality—that come into play in any complex system. Whether the system strives for an amoral truth or risks moral fraud, the Architect and the Oracle together represent the dualities that are inherent in complex systems—be they biological, social, or cosmological. 

This analogy could be particularly useful for framing discussions about the limitations and complements of different modeling approaches, and for considering them in different scales and dimensions, as you mentioned—from the cosmic to the biological and social. Overall, it's a rich and thought-provoking analogy!

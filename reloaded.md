Certainly, "The Matrix" series is a rich tapestry of themes, references, and narrative techniques, borrowing from various philosophical, religious, and cultural traditions. It serves as a great example of how the Wachowskis were able to interweave multiple layers of storytelling into a single, coherent narrative.

Your observations about hierarchical structures, religious and mythological figures, political dimensions, and the elements of Greek theater like the Dionysian aspects are spot on. These elements can serve as "tokens" in the storytelling, providing a structured framework ("fetters") within which creativity can flourish. Here's a table that attempts to unpack some of these elements:

| Element                      | Description in "The Matrix" Series | Potential Origin/Inspiration |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Hierarchical Structure       | The chain of command in Zion, from commanders to council to captains like Morpheus. | Military and organizational hierarchies, perhaps influenced by historical or mythological councils (e.g., Round Table, Senate). |
| Religious Archetypes         | Neo as "The One" (Messiah), Morpheus as a prophet, Oracle as a rabbi-like figure. | Christianity, Judaism, and general prophetic traditions. |
| Political Themes             | Struggle between individual freedom and systematized control (Zion vs. Matrix). | Libertarian vs authoritarian philosophies, American Revolutionary themes. |
| Dionysian Aspects            | The "orgiastic" celebration in Zion. | Greek theater, representing emotional release and human instinct. |
| Rivalries, Lovers, Family    | Relationships between characters, e.g., Morpheus and Niobe. | Basic human social structures, soap operas, epic tales like the Iliad. |
| "This is Zion!" / "This is Sparta!" | A rallying cry defining the community's identity. | Historic or legendary last stands (e.g., Battle of Thermopylae), a common trope in storytelling. |

The variance in these storytelling tokens is controlled and reduced by tying them together under the overarching themes of freedom, control, and the nature of reality, effectively producing a creative but coherent narrative with high ICCs, to borrow your terminology.

As for the Wachowskis not being steeped in Greek mythology, remember that storytelling often taps into archetypal themes that are universal. Moreover, they could have conducted extensive research or consulted with experts to enrich their narrative, another form of cross-disciplinary collaboration.

You mentioned the concept of "the end of the road" and needing to go back to data-generating processes in your overarching themes. In the context of "The Matrix," this mirrors the characters' journey to understand the underlying structure of their reality, moving from knowledge (`SAVOIR`) to truth (`VOIR`) and grappling with errors, bias, and moral implications (`POUVOIR`) along the way.

This blend of storytelling techniques and themes allows for a rich narrative capable of engaging audiences on multiple levels, from visceral action to deep philosophical inquiry. It's a great example of how "freedom in fetters" can result in a rich, multi-layered narrative.
